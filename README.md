# CompanionAI
This is a repository for a psuedo sentient artificial intelligence (PSAI). I call it this because the system appears to be alive by rolling random integers and those integers determine the next course of action. The original foundation for this AI was built (by me) for an OttoDIY robot. I've included the original .ino file just for kicks. The idea of this repository is to expand on the OttoDIY program by using various Python scripts for different actions. If a random integer is rolled, do "this," but if a different random integer is rolled, do "that," and in this case, "that" is going to call on a different Python script. The biggest part of this project will expanding the PSAI do anything imaginable, BUT I want it to be clear: this needs to be modular and as far away from proprietary as possible. If you have a custom robot at home, I want you to be able to use the same code. This can hopefully be achieved by adding lines informing the user what to change in individual scrpts so that the code suits your machine. That's the plan at least. And if you have an idea, let me know! I will also add that the robot I'm using for this project (to start with) is a robot made by DanMakesThings from YouTube. His documentation of his companion bot is phenomenal. If you want to build one, check out DanMakesThings' companion bot!
